Hazy I do not know what to do, day and night miss the people I like, confusion has become my biggest enemy, let me continue to degenerate
I gradually became addicted to the game world, trying to come true, but the pressure of learning and social society pulled me back again, tormenting me constantly
Depression and loneliness occupied me, in a casual attempt to fitness can release introverted depression, so I fell in love with fitness, determined to go on
Fitness let me out of depression, tearing pain can let me feel I'm still alive, make me stand up in the swamp, I began a self-discipline life
Self discipline fascinates me with learning. I need to be strong, I need to be respected by others, and I need money
