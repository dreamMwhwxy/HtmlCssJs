One kind of loneliness is that when you close your eyes, you can recall the
temperature, conversation, action, and details of the story. When you open your eyes, you feel that they
never happened. It is because life has a lot of passing, no intersection of loneliness, so we have to
start each time, good farewell.

Youth, is a gorgeous dream, there will always be empty one day, but no matter how
lonely, thank you have accompanied me that moved.

In infinite time, limited life, we are chasing the sun and the moon, chasing the dream. Looking
back, we are far away from that pure dream.

We, one day, will become me, because the happiness ahead will let you go, and the footprints you
left are the basis for my stay.
