    Designers are reimagining soignée staples for spring and summer─skirt suits, twin sets,
    below-the-knee dresses, kitten heels and frame bags─that appear anything but moth-eaten. in fact,
    fashion's neoconservative coup d'état feels deliciously defiant, given the excessively revealing
    styles pop culture celebrates. a quick flip through any supermarket tabloid yields an onslaught of
    oversexed stars and their indelicate fashion choices.

<p>Fashion is like a colorful screen. In a flash, it becomes its color.</p>

    designers filled their runways with restrained silhouettes that echo the graceful,
    showing-less-is-more aesthetic of generations past.

    Designers appreciate it when attendees wear their brand to their show. most design houses will even
    ensure that the celebrities are “appropriately” dressed in designer wear once they agree to attend.
